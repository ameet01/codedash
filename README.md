# Code Dash

## About

Code Dash is a multiplayer, interactive, realtime typing speed game for coders.

Users can choose from several different languages, challenge a friend by creating a room, and race to see who is the better typer! Users can see their opponents cursor in realtime to increase the heat of the battle.

### Technologies
- **Backend:** Node.js/Express
- **Database:** MongoDB
- **Frontend:** React/Redux
- **Websockets:** Socket.io

The purpose of this application is to create a website where a user can login and take typing tests in code, and has the ability to choose from a multitude of programming languages. There are websites that exist that do exactly this, like [typing.io](https://typing.io/); however, we would like to implement a multiplayer mode where a user can create a "room", and another user can join that room. Both players can then race each other at the same time.



### Technical Challenges

### Future plans

* Increase # of users that can race to 4
* Add more languages to race with
* More in-depth user statistics
* Code syntax highlighting
